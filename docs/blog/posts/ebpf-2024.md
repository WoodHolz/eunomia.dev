## 1.1 The Growth and Evolution of the eBPF Ecosystem

As the application scope of eBPF expands, developers are exploring its integration with other emerging technologies to further unlock its potential. Among these, the combination of eBPF with large language models (LLMs) and WebAssembly (Wasm) has gained significant attention. These innovative integrations not only introduce new use cases for eBPF but also elevate its standing within cloud-native technologies.

### 1.1.1 A Review of eBPF's Early Development and Key Breakthroughs

The origins of eBPF can be traced back to the need for increased programmability within the Linux kernel. Initially, BPF was merely a tool for network packet filtering. However, with the advancement of technology, eBPF has evolved into a general-purpose kernel extension technology. eBPF allows developers to dynamically adjust and extend kernel behavior without modifying the kernel code .

The community and enterprise contributions have been instrumental in the development of eBPF. Companies like Meta and Google have not only contributed code to enhance eBPF's capabilities but also validated its feasibility in production environments at scale. Thanks to the efforts of these enterprises, eBPF has become an essential part of cloud-native architectures, playing a significant role in system performance optimization, network security, and observability.

In modern computing environments, eBPF's applications in observability, networking, and security have significantly improved system performance and management efficiency. Specifically, eBPF can dynamically load and execute user-defined code to capture and analyze key data in real time during system operations. This capability makes eBPF particularly effective for monitoring system states, optimizing network transmission, and enhancing security measures.

For instance, the Cilium project utilizes eBPF to build an efficient container networking solution that provides fine-grained security policies and network traffic control. Similarly, bpftrace, a powerful dynamic tracing tool, enables developers to easily write and run complex system performance analysis scripts . The rise of these open-source projects has brought widespread attention and adoption of eBPF technology within the developer community.

### 1.1.2 Innovative Development Directions: Wasm and AI

**Integrating LLMs with eBPF: Exploring Potential Synergies**

Combining large language models (LLMs) with eBPF presents a promising technological innovation, especially in the areas of operating system programmability and automation. The powerful natural language processing capabilities of LLMs, when combined with eBPF's kernel-level execution abilities, could offer new methods for system extensions, security enhancements, automated testing, and the generation of complex application logic .

Traditionally, writing eBPF programs requires developers to possess deep knowledge of the operating system, presenting a significant barrier for many. Tools like Kgent [Kgent](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3672197.3673434) and [GPTtrace](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/GPTtrace) simplify the development process by incorporating LLM technology, allowing more developers to access and utilize eBPF technology. These tools eliminate the complexity of programming and significantly lower the learning curve by translating natural language prompts directly into eBPF code. This innovation enables system administrators and DevOps engineers to easily create and manage kernel extension programs, while also providing students and beginners with a straightforward entry point into eBPF programming.

Moreover, LLMs can be employed to create automated testing and feedback mechanisms to verify the correctness of eBPF programs. Through continuous feedback loops, LLMs can optimize the generated code, ensuring it aligns with expected system behavior. This approach not only enhances the security of eBPF programs but also accelerates the development and debugging process.

The integration of LLMs with eBPF can also greatly improve system observability and troubleshooting efficiency. eBPF allows developers to dynamically load programs to monitor system behavior, while LLMs can interpret this data and provide intelligent analysis and recommendations. For example, in distributed systems, eBPF can capture system calls or network events, and LLMs can help interpret this data, identify potential system issues, and automatically generate repair suggestions.

**Combining WebAssembly (Wasm) with eBPF: The New Trend in the Cloud-Native Era**

In today's cloud-native environment, WebAssembly (Wasm) and eBPF are rapidly emerging as leading lightweight virtual machine tools. Initially developed as a secure sandbox within browsers, Wasm has evolved into a high-performance, cross-platform, multi-language execution environment widely used in server-side, edge computing, and other areas . Meanwhile, eBPF, originally a powerful tool within the Linux kernel for network packet filtering, has become a versatile programmable engine within the kernel space. The convergence of these two technologies is setting new trends in cloud-native technology.

[Wasm-bpf](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/wasm-bpf) is an open-source project designed to combine the flexibility of WebAssembly with the kernel programmability of eBPF. By defining a series of abstract eBPF system interfaces, Wasm-bpf provides a unified Wasm + eBPF runtime platform for eBPF programs. Developers can use Wasm-bpf to run eBPF applications in any Wasm virtual machine or lightweight container, seamlessly accessing both kernel and user-space data. This integration not only expands WebAssembly's application scenarios but also enhances eBPF's role in network security, observability, and other fields.

Looking ahead, the combination of Wasm and eBPF holds great potential in the data plane of service meshes. Currently, the commonly used sidecar proxy model in service mesh architectures presents performance bottlenecks. Replacing traditional sidecar proxies with eBPF can significantly improve performance. However, eBPF's limitations (such as Turing incompleteness) mean it might not fully meet the demands of complex applications on its own. This is where Wasm provides a new solution. Developers can write application logic in user space, compile it into Wasm modules, and execute them in high-performance Wasm runtimes, closely integrated with eBPF. For instance, the Envoy Proxy project has adopted Wasm as an extension mechanism for the data plane, allowing developers to write proxy logic in multiple languages and execute it through Wasm, enabling efficient and secure application extensions.

## 2.2 Challenges and Bottlenecks Faced by eBPF

Although eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a transformative technology with strong capabilities in enhancing operating system observability, network performance, and security, it also faces several challenges and bottlenecks as it evolves. These issues not only impact the adoption and widespread use of eBPF but also introduce new complexities and risks for developers and operations personnel. Let's delve into these challenges and explore potential solutions.

**eBPF's Programming Limitations**

eBPF was originally designed to address specific network and security issues, and its execution environment is tightly restricted to ensure program safety and controllability. However, this non-Turing complete environment also brings limitations. eBPF uses a subset of the C language and operates under a strict execution model. This means that when developers write complex logic, they must consider various constraints, such as limited stack space, limited loop iterations, and strict memory access boundaries. These constraints prevent malicious code from damaging the kernel but also make development more challenging  .

For instance, when implementing complex data structures or algorithms, developers must find alternative solutions or remodel the problem to fit eBPF's constraints. Additionally, eBPF's programming model, with its memory access and computational resource limitations, forces some tasks that could have been completed in user space to be simplified or implemented through multiple kernel-to-user space interactions. This not only increases program complexity but can also negatively impact system performance. Therefore, how to enhance eBPF's programming capabilities without sacrificing security remains a critical area for ongoing research and exploration.

To address these complexities, the eBPF community and developers have been working to improve existing tools and frameworks. Tools like bpftrace and bcc have greatly simplified the process of writing and debugging eBPF programs. Additionally, the introduction of LLMs (large language models) offers new approaches. LLMs enable developers to write eBPF code more naturally or even directly translate natural language descriptions into eBPF programs, reducing the programming barrier. However, simplifying the development process of eBPF without sacrificing functionality remains a challenge that needs to be addressed  .

**Kernel and Application Scenario Complexity**

The powerful functionality of eBPF requires developers to have a deep understanding of kernel operations, making its learning and application threshold quite high. Developing and debugging eBPF programs requires a deep understanding of the Linux kernel's working mechanisms, including kernel module principles, system call implementations, and memory management techniques. For most developers, acquiring this knowledge requires not only high skill but also continuous experience accumulation through practice. This results in a steep learning curve for eBPF, limiting its spread and application among a broader developer community.

Moreover, different Linux distributions and kernel versions vary in their support for eBPF, posing cross-platform compatibility challenges for developers. Some kernel versions may lack support for specific eBPF features, or eBPF programs may behave differently under different kernel configurations. To ensure that eBPF programs run stably across various environments, developers must conduct extensive testing and adjustments. This not only increases development costs but also extends the time-to-market for products.

As eBPF's application scenarios expand, its complexity also increases. This not only raises the skill requirements for developers but also complicates the debugging and optimization of eBPF programs. To mitigate these complexities, future research and development efforts could focus on creating smarter IDEs and debugging tools. These tools should be capable of automatically identifying and fixing common programming errors, providing optimization suggestions to developers, and reducing the difficulty of eBPF program development. These advancements will enable more developers to utilize eBPF technology, improving its application efficiency and effectiveness in real production environments.

**eBPF's Security**

The kernel-level execution of eBPF introduces significant security risks. If eBPF programs are maliciously exploited, they could lead to kernel crashes or sensitive data leaks. To address this, the Linux kernel includes an eBPF verifier, which performs strict static analysis and checks when loading eBPF programs, ensuring they do not violate memory access boundaries or execute illegal operations.

While the verifier effectively prevents the execution of malicious code in most cases, recent research and real-world incidents have shown that the verifier is not infallible. Sophisticated attack techniques can sometimes bypass the verifier’s checks, exploiting kernel vulnerabilities to perform unauthorized operations. This indicates that the current eBPF security model still has room for improvement. Researchers have proposed various solutions to enhance eBPF's security, such as introducing hardware-based isolation techniques (e.g., Intel's Memory Protection Keys) or using software methods (e.g., SandBPF) to further isolate eBPF program execution. Although these solutions theoretically improve eBPF's security, they face numerous practical challenges, such as hardware support availability and software isolation performance overheads.

Moreover, as the application scope of eBPF broadens, so do the security challenges it faces. Enhancing eBPF program security while maintaining high performance remains a crucial area for future development.

**Performance Trade-offs and Tool Coexistence**

One of eBPF's primary advantages is its high performance, particularly in network packet processing and real-time system monitoring. However, as eBPF's functionality expands, its performance faces new challenges. Specifically, eBPF was initially optimized for specific tasks, such as network traffic filtering or system event tracing, but when applied to broader scenarios, performance bottlenecks can arise. For instance, when multiple eBPF programs run concurrently, system resource contention may lead to overall performance degradation. In such cases, developers need to balance functionality and performance to ensure that eBPF programs meet requirements without overburdening the system.

Another significant issue is the fragmentation of the eBPF toolchain. Currently, the development and deployment tools surrounding eBPF are becoming increasingly diverse, which, while expanding developers' options, also introduces compatibility and interoperability challenges. Different tools may have inconsistent interfaces and behaviors, complicating the management and integration of eBPF programs in complex systems. Furthermore, the fragmentation of the toolchain can hinder the rapid promotion of technical achievements to production environments, limiting the widespread adoption of eBPF technology.

To address these issues, the community is promoting the standardization of the eBPF toolchain and developing more unified and user-friendly frameworks to help developers better manage the development, testing, and deployment of eBPF programs. In the future, by integrating the toolchain and optimizing performance, eBPF will be able to play its intended role in more scenarios.

**The Need for Standardization**

As eBPF is increasingly applied to different platforms, such as Windows and macOS, the need for standardization becomes more critical. Without unified standards, compatibility issues may arise, increasing the burden on developers. To address this, the eBPF community and related industry organizations should expedite the standardization process by establishing unified APIs and programming specifications to ensure consistency and compatibility of eBPF programs across different platforms. This approach will not only improve development efficiency but also promote the widespread application of eBPF technology.

## 3.1 Future Trends in eBPF Development

eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) was initially developed on the Linux platform and has gradually expanded to other operating systems like Windows and macOS as its powerful capabilities have been recognized. In the future, eBPF is expected to become a cross-platform infrastructure technology. By providing a unified programming interface, eBPF allows developers to run the same code seamlessly across multiple platforms, enhancing development efficiency and supporting interoperability and consistency across multi-platform systems. As eBPF becomes more widespread on other operating systems, it is poised to become a standard component of modern operating system ecosystems, offering a unified solution for network monitoring, security, and system observability across different environments.

### 3.2 eBPF for Windows

[eBPF for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows) is a project initiated by Microsoft aimed at bringing the powerful capabilities of eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) from Linux to the Windows system. Originally developed for the Linux kernel to enhance system observability, network monitoring, and security, this project allows developers to run eBPF programs in Windows environments, offering similar functionalities as on Linux without modifying core kernel code.

The eBPF for Windows project integrates many common eBPF toolchains and APIs from the Linux platform, making it easier for developers familiar with the Linux ecosystem to develop on Windows. This project supports various eBPF hooks and helpers, and it can perform Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, converting eBPF bytecode into native Windows kernel instructions for efficient execution, akin to the performance of native kernel code.

A key advancement of eBPF for Windows is the introduction of diagnostic tools and secure deployment pipelines. The project is integrated with the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), allowing eBPF programs to be compiled into Windows driver binary files, ensuring these programs can be securely signed and deployed in production systems. This process includes rigorous verification steps to ensure the security and correctness of eBPF programs, mitigating potential security risks.

Overall, eBPF for Windows represents a significant step toward making eBPF a cross-platform technology, enabling developers to use the same powerful tools to enhance system observability and security in both Linux and Windows environments.

### 3.3 User-Space eBPF Runtime: bpftime

[bpftime](https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/bpftime) is a user-space eBPF runtime designed to overcome some of the limitations of kernel-space eBPF and fully exploit the potential of eBPF in user space. Originally designed as a tool for network packet filtering, eBPF has now become a powerful system-level extension technology widely used in performance analysis, security policies, and other fields. While eBPF has strong capabilities in kernel space, it encounters bottlenecks in certain application scenarios due to security, scalability, and performance limitations. bpftime aims to address these challenges by providing a more flexible and efficient solution by introducing eBPF into user space.

A key feature of bpftime is its compatibility with existing eBPF tools and ecosystems. By being compatible with tools like bpftrace and BCC/libbpf-tools, bpftime allows users to execute unmodified eBPF scripts in user space for system call or user-space function tracing. This design not only facilitates the migration of existing eBPF users to user space but also provides developers with a debugging environment that does not require kernel modifications or kernel eBPF support.

In terms of performance, bpftime offers efficient Uprobe and system call tracing capabilities. Traditional Uprobe involves multiple context switches between kernel space and user space, often resulting in significant performance overhead. bpftime avoids these overheads by embedding eBPF programs into the traced process's function call context through binary rewriting. This allows for dynamic tracing and extension, enabling features such as modifying function return values, code extension, hot patching, and fault injection. Compared to kernel Uprobe, bpftime's Uprobe implementation is significantly more performant, making it suitable for high-performance applications.

Additionally, bpftime features a built-in LLVM-based JIT compiler and AOT compiler, further improving the execution efficiency of eBPF programs. Compared to other user-space eBPF runtimes, bpftime's JIT compiler offers near-native code execution efficiency and better cross-platform support. The AOT compiler allows pre-compiling eBPF bytecode into machine code files for specific architectures, making it particularly useful for deployment on embedded devices and significantly reducing compilation startup time.

Beyond these features, bpftime demonstrates potential in various exploratory application scenarios. For example, bpftime can enable user-space fault injection, eBPF-based Nginx module extensions, and enhanced Fuse file system capabilities. Especially in modern eBPF observability tools, bpftime can achieve cross-boundary analysis between kernel space and user space, providing a more comprehensive perspective for system performance tuning and fault diagnosis.

As an exploratory project still under development, bpftime represents an important direction for user-space eBPF. In the future, it is expected to further expand in kernel compatibility, performance optimization, and additional application scenarios, offering new possibilities for the application of eBPF in modern computing.

## 3.4 eBPF's Standardization and Emerging Application Fields

As eBPF's application continues to expand across different operating systems, it is gradually evolving from a Linux-exclusive technology into a cross-platform infrastructure technology. Beyond its deep integration within the Linux kernel, eBPF is beginning to take root on Windows and is expected to extend to other operating systems like macOS and FreeBSD. This cross-platform expansion of eBPF paves the way for it to become a standardized layer across various operating systems. In the future, eBPF is likely to become an indispensable component of operating systems, providing developers with a consistent programming interface and execution environment, simplifying cross-platform development complexity.

This trend toward standardization offers numerous potential benefits. First, cross-platform eBPF enables developers to write code once and seamlessly execute it across multiple operating systems, significantly improving development efficiency and software portability. Second, as more operating systems adopt eBPF, the industry's toolchains, frameworks, and libraries will also become more unified, further reducing developers' cognitive load when switching between platforms. Moreover, the standardization of eBPF can foster industry collaboration, encouraging developers and vendors across different operating systems to jointly drive the development and optimization of eBPF, invigorating the entire ecosystem.

For instance, the standardization of eBPF may play a crucial role in future cloud computing and edge computing environments. As enterprises increasingly adopt hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, a cross-platform standardized layer could enable eBPF to act as a bridge connecting different cloud environments and edge devices, offering unified monitoring, security, and network management solutions for these dispersed computing resources. In this way, eBPF helps to simplify complex IT infrastructure while enhancing its overall security and performance.

### Emerging Application Fields: Driving Cloud-Native Architecture Development

As eBPF's capabilities expand, its application in cloud-native infrastructure is becoming increasingly prevalent. eBPF offers powerful tools for performance monitoring, security policy enforcement, and network optimization, which are critical components of modern cloud-native architectures. Specifically, eBPF enables real-time system data capture, deep analysis, and automatic system performance optimization based on this data, making it an ideal tool for cloud-native environments.

A typical use case is eBPF's network optimization within containerized environments. Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes demand high network performance, particularly in large-scale deployments. Traditional methods for network monitoring and optimization typically involve multiple layers of proxies and middleware, leading to unnecessary latency and complexity. In contrast, eBPF can implement network traffic monitoring and optimization directly within the kernel, avoiding additional performance overhead while providing finer control. This capability makes eBPF a key technology for improving container network performance and drives further development of cloud-native infrastructure, such as service meshes.

Additionally, eBPF's application in security is expanding. In cloud-native environments, security threats are omnipresent, and effective system protection is a priority for enterprises. eBPF provides a built-in kernel security mechanism, allowing systems to monitor and respond to potential threats in real time. For example, eBPF can trigger security policies immediately upon detecting suspicious behavior, preventing further spread of attacks. By integrating with existing security frameworks, eBPF not only enhances system security but also provides more efficient threat detection and response mechanisms.
