# Case Studies of Bugs in Productivity Software and Game Extensions/Plugins (2018–2024)

To address the question, we’ve gathered over 20 documented cases of bugs in extensions or plugins for **productivity software** (like Office add-ins, browser extensions for productivity tools) and **gaming platforms** (game engine plugins and mods). Each case includes the bug ID or CVE (if available), affected extension and platform, bug type, root cause, impact on the host system, and the resolution or fix. We then analyze common patterns and their broader impacts on stability, maintainability, and security.

Below is the consolidated report in a table format. The table lists 21 documented cases (both for productivity software plugins and gaming mods/plugins) where the bugs occur within the extensions/plugins themselves (not in the core software). Each row includes the case number, Bug ID/CVE (or N/A if not available), the affected extension and its platform, the bug type, a brief description of the root cause (with the reference link included as part of the text), the impact on the host system, and the resolution/fix (with links as needed).

*Note:* The last several Minecraft mod cases (ServerRPExposer, ARRP, MCRPX, Reden, Advanced Backups) were all discovered as part of a coordinated disclosure in 2024 regarding **Zip file path traversal in mods** ([Vulnerability research report for Minecraft mods. · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/apple502j/193358682885fe1a6708309ce934e4ed#:~:text=Several%20Minecraft%20mods%20were%20found,exploitation%20significantly%20differs%20across%20mods)). The technical root cause in each was the same: failure to check for `..` or absolute paths when extracting archives, a well-known issue that can lead to **files written outside the intended directory** ([Vulnerability research report for Minecraft mods. · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/apple502j/193358682885fe1a6708309ce934e4ed#:~:text=Technical%20Background)). Mod developers quickly released patches once informed, underscoring the importance of secure coding even in game mods.

## Patterns in Extension/Plugin Bugs

Analyzing the above cases reveals several **common patterns**:

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** A majority of these bugs stem from not validating input data that the extension/plugin receives. For example, many Minecraft mods did not validate filenames inside zip archives, leading to path traversal exploits ([Vulnerability research report for Minecraft mods. · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/apple502j/193358682885fe1a6708309ce934e4ed#:~:text=Technical%20Background)). Similarly, the WebEx extension didn’t properly sanitize incoming messages ([Critical RCE Vulnerability Found in Cisco WebEx Extensions, Again — Patch Now!](https://thehackernews.com/2017/07/cisco-webex-vulnerability.html#:~:text=Discovered%20by%20Tavis%20Ormandy%20of,in%20the%20WebEx%20browser%20extension)), and LastPass/Grammarly failed to validate or restrict what web pages could do with their extension APIs ([Grammarly Patches Chrome Extension Bug That Exposed Users’ Docs | Threatpost](https://threatpost.com/grammarly-patches-chrome-extension-bug-that-exposed-users-docs/129794/#:~:text=Ormandy%E2%80%99s%20original%20post%20included%20just,manually%20or%20via%20a%20script)) ([NVD - CVE-2019-16371](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16371#:~:text=LogMeIn%20LastPass%20before%204,can%20be%20bypassed%20via%20clickjacking)). In short, untrusted data (whether from a document, network packet, or web page) was often trusted by the extension – resulting in XXE, XSS, RCE, or logic bugs.

- **Over-privileged or Misused APIs:** Extensions frequently run with elevated privileges or deep integration, and a bug can abuse that. The Evernote and Grammarly cases show how a logic flaw can break the **browser’s normal security model** – e.g., Evernote’s bug broke Chrome’s domain isolation, allowing one site to access data from others ([Evernote Chrome Extension Vulnerability: Guardio's Analysis](https://guard.io/blog/evernote-universal-xss-vulnerability#:~:text=In%20May%202019%20Guardio%27s%20research,12592)). In essence, the extension’s broad permissions (meant to help the user clip web content or check grammar everywhere) became a liability when the extension misbehaved. Likewise, Outlook add-ins like MailStore’s and KnowBe4’s had the ability to connect to servers or update software; without proper checks (certificate validation, update signature verification), those abilities turned into vulnerabilities ([CVE - Search Results](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=outlook#:~:text=CVE,of%20the%20product%2C%20or%20upon)) ([CVE -Search Results](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=outlook#:~:text=could%20allow%20an%20attacker%20to,a%20malicious%20server%20under%20their)).

- **Design/Logic Flaws due to Complexity:** Some bugs were not low-level memory errors, but high-level logic issues – e.g., LastPass’s credential leak was due to UI logic and clickjacking, not a buffer overflow. These arise from the **complex interactions** extensions have (UI events, multiple contexts, etc.). Tavis Ormandy noted that such issues often evade automated detection and require careful human review ([Grammarly Patches Chrome Extension Bug That Exposed Users’ Docs | Threatpost](https://threatpost.com/grammarly-patches-chrome-extension-bug-that-exposed-users-docs/129794/#:~:text=Responding%20to%20a%20Twitter%20user,capabilities%20for%20Chrome%20extension%20code)). In game mods, logic flaws like item duplication (JEI/REI) were likely overlooked in testing since they don’t crash the game – they break game rules.

- **Lack of Security Focus in Third-Party Development:** Many of these extensions/plugins are by third parties (e.g., SAP add-in, mods by community developers, even large companies like Cisco or LastPass). In several cases, the core application might be secure, but the extension opened a hole. For instance, Microsoft Office itself wasn’t vulnerable, but the SAP add-in introduced an XXE flaw ([CVE-2021-21470 : SAP EPM Add-in for Microsoft Office, version - 1010 and SAP EPM Add-in for SAP A](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2021-21470/#:~:text=SAP%20EPM%20Add,and%20availability%20of%20the%20application)). The patterns suggest that extension developers might not have the same security rigorous processes as the platform vendor. Community mod developers, in particular, historically focused on functionality over security, leading to decades-old bugs like directory traversal persisting ([Vulnerability research report for Minecraft mods. · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/apple502j/193358682885fe1a6708309ce934e4ed#:~:text=Technical%20Background)).

- **Updates and Sandbox Mechanisms:** Some patterns involve how extensions update or isolate code. KnowBe4’s PAB add-in didn’t verify update integrity ([CVE -

](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=outlook#:~:text=could%20allow%20an%20attacker%20to,a%20malicious%20server%20under%20their)), a pattern also seen in other software supply chain attacks (not unique to extensions, but very relevant as extensions often auto-update). On the flip side, failures to **sandbox execution** appear in mods like OpenComputers (Lua thread running on the main server thread) and in WebEx (exposing native code execution to webpages). Extensions that execute code (scripts, macros, etc.) need strong sandboxing; when that fails, the host is at risk.

## Impact on Stability, Maintainability, and Security

Bugs in extensions/plugins can have **outsized impacts** on the host system’s stability, maintainability, and security:

- **Stability:** A flawed plugin can severely affect the stability of the host application or system. We saw how a single mod (OpenComputers) could hang an entire game server ([CVE -
Search Results
](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=minecraft#:~:text=programmable%20computers%20and%20robots%20to,GTNH)). Office add-ins have been known to crash Outlook or Excel if they mis-handle memory or events (e.g., the SAP add-in could have caused errors if malicious XML triggered odd behavior). Because extensions run in-process with their host, a crash in an extension *crashes the host app*. For example, a buggy Outlook add-in can make Outlook unrecoverable until disabled ([Outlook Slow/Crashes - Slow and Disabled Add-ins](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/outlook-slowcrashes-slow-and-disabled-add-ins/9f1d286b-f644-417a-b0e4-d413bf8a58c4#:~:text=Outlook%20Slow%2FCrashes%20,document%2C%20under%20Outlook%20safe)). In gaming, mods that leak memory or CPU (infinite loops, excessive item spawn) can make a game unplayable. Thus, a seemingly optional add-on can undermine the reliability of the entire platform.

- **Maintainability:** Extensions add complexity to a system, which can hurt maintainability. Each bug requires coordination between the plugin developer and the host environment. If an extension is popular (like WebEx or LastPass), multiple updates might be rushed (as in 2017, WebEx needed a second patch) which can be challenging to manage for IT admins and users. In mods, once a vulnerability is found, maintainers have to quickly release fixes and users need to update mods across potentially thousands of servers or clients – not an easy task. Additionally, plugin ecosystems often have dependencies (e.g., ARRP library mod affecting other mods ([Vulnerability research report for Minecraft mods. · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/apple502j/193358682885fe1a6708309ce934e4ed#:~:text=ARRP%20in%20the%20following%20ways%3A))), so one fix might require many projects to update, complicating maintenance. Poorly designed extensions (no auto-update or code signing, etc.) increase the maintenance burden on users to manually track and install safe versions.

- **Security:** Perhaps the most significant impact is on overall system security. Extensions and mods **expand the attack surface** of the host application. A secure core application can be undermined by an insecure plugin. For instance, Chrome’s robust isolation was bypassed by the Evernote and Grammarly extensions’ bugs ([Evernote Chrome Extension Vulnerability: Guardio's Analysis](https://guard.io/blog/evernote-universal-xss-vulnerability#:~:text=In%20May%202019%20Guardio%27s%20research,12592)) ([Grammarly Patches Chrome Extension Bug That Exposed Users’ Docs | Threatpost](https://threatpost.com/grammarly-patches-chrome-extension-bug-that-exposed-users-docs/129794/#:~:text=Grammarly%20has%20fixed%20a%20bug,and%20view%20their%20account%E2%80%99s%20documents)). A password manager like LastPass, meant to improve security, briefly *exposed* passwords due to its extension flaw ([NVD - CVE-2019-16371](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16371#:~:text=LogMeIn%20LastPass%20before%204,can%20be%20bypassed%20via%20clickjacking)). Many extensions run with elevated privileges (browser extensions can often read/modify all websites data, Office add-ins can access documents, game mods can run code in the game engine). As a result, any vulnerability can lead to a full compromise: WebEx’s extension allowed complete remote code execution on Windows ([CVE-2017-3823 : An issue was discovered in the Cisco WebEx Extension before 1.0.7 on Google Chro](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-3823/#:~:text=extensions%20could%20allow%20an%20unauthenticated%2C,privileges%20of%20the%20affected%20browser)). In enterprise settings, something like the KnowBe4 add-in bug could let an attacker pivot into a corporate network via a simple Outlook plugin exploit. In summary, extensions often operate at a high trust level; when they go wrong, they can **violate user trust, breach data confidentiality, or open the door to malware**.

- **Security Maintenance Debt:** From a process perspective, extension bugs highlight the importance of keeping plugins updated. Users often install extensions and forget about them. As Guardio noted, browser extensions can be risky and need to be maintained and updated just like any software ([Evernote Chrome Extension Vulnerability: Guardio's Analysis](https://guard.io/blog/evernote-universal-xss-vulnerability#:~:text=,Users%20should%20regularly%20review%20their)). Unpatched extensions become lingering vulnerabilities (for example, someone still using an old WebEx plugin in 2018 would be an easy target). This creates a maintainability challenge: both users and platform providers must vigilantly manage extensions (browsers now can remotely disable known-bad extensions, Office might disable crashing add-ins ([Add-ins decreased performance or caused Outlook to crash](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/add-ins-decreased-performance-or-caused-outlook-to/80ebb081-04b2-43e6-ae63-feedeea4dbb1#:~:text=crash%20answers,or%20caused%20Outlook%20to%20crash))). The **need for frequent updates** to fix bugs can itself be a source of security risk if the update mechanism is not secure (as seen with the PAB case).

- **Impact Beyond the App (Systemic effects):** Some plugin flaws have consequences beyond just the immediate app. The cloud metadata mod exploits show how a vulnerability in a game mod can escalate to cloud infrastructure compromise ([CVE -
Search Results
](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=minecraft#:~:text=1.20.1,a%20Minecraft%20mod%20that%20adds)). Similarly, an Office add-in with a vulnerability could be a stepping stone for a targeted attack (e.g., a malicious document that exploits an add-in to run code). Thus, the security impact can range from local (game cheating, app crash) to systemic (network breach, malware installation).

In conclusion, extension/plugin bugs frequently follow patterns of **unchecked inputs, improper privilege use, and inadequate isolation**. These bugs can severely impact stability (crashes, hangs), **erode maintainability** (requiring urgent patches and careful version control), and **punch holes in security** defenses (leading to data leaks or code execution). The collection of cases from 2018–2024 demonstrates that while extensions enhance functionality, they must be developed and reviewed with the same rigor as core software – otherwise, they become the weakest link in the chain. As one security research team put it, *browser extensions can be very powerful and thus very risky if not properly maintained* ([Evernote Chrome Extension Vulnerability: Guardio's Analysis](https://guard.io/blog/evernote-universal-xss-vulnerability#:~:text=,Users%20should%20regularly%20review%20their)). The same holds true for any platform: the host is only as secure and stable as the plugins it loads.
